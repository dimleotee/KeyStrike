## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
https://github.com/dimleotee/KeyStrike.git

# Navigate into the project folder
cd KeyStrike

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv keystike-env
source keystike-env/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Recommendations

* Use only in a **safe lab environment** or against systems you own or have permission to test.
* Pair it with tools like Wireshark, Burp Suite, or Gophish for a full red-team simulation.
* Use `rockyou.txt` or filtered custom wordlists for better brute force accuracy.

## Description
 **What's Next?**
We’re excited to announce that KeyStrike v2 will introduce **LLM (Large Language Model) integration** to elevate offensive security automation. The upcoming version will feature an AI controller to:

- Recommend brute-force strategies based on target response.
- Dynamically select the most effective scanning modules.
- Log and summarize attacks in natural language for reports.
- Assist red teamers in real-time decisions.

🔒 KeyStrike v1 is just the beginning — the next evolution brings AI to ethical hacking.
